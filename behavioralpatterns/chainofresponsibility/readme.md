The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain. It decouples the sender of the request from its receivers and allows multiple objects to handle the request independently.

## Components

The Chain of Responsibility pattern consists of the following components:

## Handler: 
Defines the interface for handling requests. It typically includes a method, such as Handle(request), that handles the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

## ConcreteHandler: 
Implements the handler interface and provides the implementation for handling the request. It also holds a reference to the next handler in the chain.

## Client: 
Creates the chain of handlers and sends requests to the first handler in the chain.

## Example

In our example, we have implemented the Chain of Responsibility pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Request struct that represents a request to be handled.
2. We define the Handler interface that declares the methods SetNext(handler Handler) and Handle(request Request).
3. We implement three concrete handlers, ConcreteHandlerA, ConcreteHandlerB, and ConcreteHandlerC, that handle requests of specific types. Each concrete handler implements the Handler interface and can handle the request if it matches its criteria. If it can't handle the request, it passes it to the next handler in the chain.
4. Each concrete handler has a reference to the next handler in the chain and sets it using the SetNext(handler Handler) method.
5. In the main function, we create instances of the concrete handlers, handlerA, handlerB, and handlerC.
6. We set the chain of responsibility by calling SetNext() to connect handlerA to handlerB, and handlerB to handlerC.
7. We create four requests, request1, request2, request3, and request4, with different contents.
8. We call the Handle() method on handlerA for each request.
9. Each handler in the chain checks if it can handle the request based on its criteria. If it can handle the request, it performs the necessary actions. If not, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.
10. The handlers in the chain handle the requests according to their criteria, and if no handler can handle the request, an appropriate message is printed.
11. By using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, we achieve flexibility and loose coupling between the sender and receiver of a request. Each handler can independently decide whether to handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. It allows for dynamic modification of the chain and promotes code reusability and scalability.
