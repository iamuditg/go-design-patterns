The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It decouples the traversal algorithm from the aggregate object, making it easier to iterate over different types of collections or aggregate structures.

## Components
The Iterator pattern consists of the following components:

## Iterator: 
Defines the interface for accessing and iterating over elements in the collection. It typically includes methods such as HasNext() to check if there are more elements, and Next() to retrieve the next element.

## Concrete Iterator: 
Implements the iterator interface and keeps track of the current position within the collection. It provides the necessary methods to iterate over the collection.

## Aggregate: 
Defines the interface for creating an iterator. It typically includes a method such as CreateIterator() that returns a new iterator for the collection.

## Concrete Aggregate: 
Implements the aggregate interface and provides the collection or data structure to be iterated over. It creates an iterator specific to its collection.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Iterator pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Iterator interface that declares methods such as HasNext() and Next() for iterating over the elements of a collection.
2. We implement a concrete iterator, ConcreteIterator, that keeps track of the current position in the collection and provides the necessary methods for iteration.
3. We define the Aggregate interface that declares a method, CreateIterator(), which creates a new iterator specific to the collection.
4. We implement a concrete aggregate, ConcreteAggregate, that stores the collection of elements and creates an iterator specific to that collection.
5. In the main function, we create a collection of elements.
6. We create an instance of the ConcreteAggregate with the collection.
7. We create an iterator by calling the CreateIterator method on the aggregate. The iterator is specific to the collection in the aggregate.
8. We iterate over the collection using the iterator. The iterator's HasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements, and the Next() method is used to retrieve the next element.
9. As a result, we can traverse and access the elements of the collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. The iterator encapsulates the traversal logic, and the aggregate provides a way to create an iterator for its specific collection.
10. By using the Iterator pattern, we achieve a separation between the traversal algorithm and the collection being traversed. This allows us to iterate over different types of collections using a common interface, and it provides a standardized way to access elements in a collection without exposing its internal structure. Additionally, it promotes flexibility and extensibility, as new types of collections can be added without modifying the iterator or client code.
