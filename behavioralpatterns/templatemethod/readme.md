The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an abstract class, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementations for certain steps of the algorithm. The template method provides a framework for executing an algorithm, with specific steps implemented by subclasses.

## Components
The Template Method pattern consists of the following components:

## Abstract Class: 
Represents the abstract class that defines the template method, which encapsulates the algorithm's structure. It may also include abstract methods or default implementations for some steps of the algorithm.

## Concrete Classes: 
Concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class and provide specific implementations for the abstract or hook methods defined in the abstract class.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Template Method pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the AbstractClass interface that represents the abstract class with a template method. The TemplateMethod function represents the skeleton of the algorithm.
2. We implement two concrete classes, ConcreteClassA and ConcreteClassB, which implement the AbstractClass interface. Each concrete class provides its own implementations for specific steps of the algorithm.
3. The ConcreteClassA implements the Step1 and Step2 methods as the specific implementations for the algorithm steps.
4. The ConcreteClassB implements the Step1 and Step3 methods as the specific implementations for the algorithm steps.
5. In the main function, we create instances of ConcreteClassA and ConcreteClassB.
6. We call the TemplateMethod on each instance, which executes the algorithm defined in the abstract class.
7. As a result, each concrete class executes its specific steps of the algorithm, while the overall structure and order of execution are defined by the template method in the abstract class.
