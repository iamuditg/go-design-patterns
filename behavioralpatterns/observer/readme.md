Observer Pattern in Go
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. In this pattern, when the state of an object (subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are automatically notified and updated. This allows for loosely coupled communication between the subject and observers, enabling them to interact without having explicit knowledge of each other.

Components
The Observer pattern consists of the following components:

## Subject: 
Defines the interface for the subject being observed. It includes methods to register observers, remove observers, and notify observers of state changes.

## Observer: 
Defines the interface for the observer that receives updates. It typically includes an Update method to handle the update notifications.

## ConcreteSubject: 
A concrete implementation of the subject interface. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them when its state changes.

## ConcreteObserver: 
A concrete implementation of the observer interface. It defines the behavior to be performed when it receives an update from the subject.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Observer pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Subject and Observer interfaces that represent the subject and observer roles, respectively.
2. The ConcreteSubject struct implements the Subject interface. It maintains a list of observers and provides methods to register, remove, and notify observers. When the SetValue method is called, the subject's value is updated, and it notifies all registered observers by calling their Update method.
3. The ConcreteObserver struct implements the Observer interface. It defines the behavior to be performed when it receives an update from the subject. In this example, it simply prints a message indicating the received update.
4. In the main function, we create an instance of the ConcreteSubject as the subject. We also create two instances of the ConcreteObserver as observers.
5. The observers are registered with the subject using the RegisterObserver method.
6. The SetValue method is called on the subject, setting a new value. This triggers the subject to notify all registered observers.
7. As a result, both observers receive the update and print messages indicating the received value.

By using the Observer pattern, we achieve loose coupling between the subject and observers. The subject doesn't need to know the specific implementations of the observers, and the observers don't need to be aware of each other. This flexibility allows for easy extensibility and modularity in the codebase.
