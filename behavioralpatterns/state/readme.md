The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates individual states as separate classes and delegates the behavior to the current state object. The State pattern enables an object to appear to change its class dynamically as its internal state changes.

## Components
The State pattern consists of the following components:

## State: 
Defines the interface for the states. It declares methods that handle the state-specific behavior.

## Concrete States: 
Concrete implementations of the state interface. Each concrete state encapsulates a specific behavior for the object based on its internal state.

## Context: 
Represents the object that uses the state. It maintains a reference to the current state and provides methods for setting the state and performing actions based on the current state.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the State pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the State interface that declares a method, Handle, which represents the behavior associated with the state.
2. We implement two concrete states, ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB, which implement the State interface. Each concrete state encapsulates specific behavior associated with that state.
3. The Context struct represents the context or object that uses the state. It maintains a reference to the current state and provides methods for setting the state and triggering the state's handling by invoking the Handle method.
4. In the main function, we create an instance of the Context as the context that will use the state.
5. We set the initial state to ConcreteStateA using the SetState method.
6. We perform requests on the context, which triggers the handling of the state by invoking the Request method. The current state's Handle method is called, and the behavior associated with that state is executed.
7. As a result, the context dynamically changes its behavior based on the current state. Each state handles the request differently, and in our example, we alternate between ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB with each request.
8. When a state is handled, it can also transition the context to a different state by calling the SetState method of the context.
9. By using the State pattern, we achieve a clean separation between the behavior of an object and its internal state. The object can switch between different states, and the behavior associated with each state is encapsulated within separate state classes. This promotes extensibility and maintainability, as new states can be added without modifying existing code, and the object's behavior can easily be modified by switching states.
