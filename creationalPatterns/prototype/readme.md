The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of objects by cloning or copying existing objects, known as prototypes, instead of creating new instances from scratch. It provides a way to produce new objects by copying the properties of existing objects, which can be beneficial in terms of performance and flexibility.

## Components
The Prototype pattern consists of the following components:

## Cloneable: 
Represents the interface that objects must implement to support cloning. It typically declares a Clone() method that returns a clone of the object.

## ConcretePrototype: 
Represents a concrete implementation of the prototype that implements the Cloneable interface. It performs a deep copy of the object to create a new instance when cloning.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Prototype pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Cloneable interface that declares the Clone() method, which returns a Cloneable object.
2. We implement the ConcretePrototype struct that represents a concrete prototype. It has a data field of type string.
3. We implement the Clone() method for the ConcretePrototype struct, which performs a deep copy of the data field to create a new instance of the prototype.
4. In the main function, we create an instance of the ConcretePrototype as the original prototype.
5. We clone the prototype by calling the Clone() method, which creates a new instance of the prototype with the same data value.
6. We modify the data value of the cloned object to demonstrate that it is a separate instance.
7. We print the data values of the original prototype and the cloned object to verify that they are distinct.

By using the Prototype pattern, we can create new objects by cloning existing ones, avoiding the need to create new instances from scratch. This can be beneficial in terms of performance when creating multiple similar objects. It also provides flexibility, as we can easily customize the cloned objects by modifying their properties as needed.
