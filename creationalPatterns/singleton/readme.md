The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, providing a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used in scenarios where only one instance of a class is required throughout the application.

## Components
The Singleton pattern consists of the following components:

## Singleton: 
Represents the singleton class. It usually has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation and a static method to provide access to the single instance.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Singleton pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Singleton struct that represents the singleton object. It has a data field of type string.
2. We declare a variable instance of type *Singleton as a global variable to hold the single instance of the singleton.
3. We use the sync.Once package to ensure that the initialization code to create the singleton instance is executed only once.
4. We define the GetInstance() function that returns the singleton instance. Inside the function, we use the once.Do() function to ensure that the instance creation code is executed only once.
5. In the main function, we call the GetInstance() function to retrieve the singleton instance.
6. We print the data field of the singleton instance to verify its uniqueness.

By using the Singleton pattern, we can ensure that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application. This provides a global point of access to the instance, allowing multiple parts of the application to use the same instance without the need for manual coordination or synchronization. The Singleton pattern is useful in scenarios where we need a single, shared instance of an object, such as managing database connections, logging systems, or configuration settings.
