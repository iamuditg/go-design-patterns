The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the construction of complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.

## Components
The Builder pattern consists of the following components:

## Product: 
Represents the complex object being built. It typically contains several parts or attributes.

## Builder: 
Defines the builder interface that declares the methods for building each part of the product.

## ConcreteBuilder: 
Implements the builder interface and provides the implementation for building each part of the product. It maintains the state of the product being built.

## Director: 
Controls the building process by directing the builder. It knows the specific order in which the parts should be built.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Builder pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Product struct that represents the complex object being built. It contains several parts: part1, part2, and part3.
2. We define the Builder interface that declares the methods BuildPart1(), BuildPart2(), BuildPart3(), and GetProduct(). Each method is responsible for building a specific part of the product.
3. We implement the ConcreteBuilder struct that implements the Builder interface. It maintains the state of the product being built and provides the implementation for building each part of the product.
4. We define the Director struct that controls the building process. It has a reference to a Builder and directs the builder to build the product in a specific order by calling the corresponding builder methods.
5. In the main function, we create an instance of the Director and an instance of the ConcreteBuilder.
6. We set the builder for the director using the SetBuilder() method.
7. We call the Construct() method on the director, which triggers the building process. The director directs the builder to build each part of the product in a specific order.
8. Finally, we obtain the built product using the GetProduct() method of the builder.

By using the Builder pattern, we achieve a clear separation between the construction of an object and its representation. The builder encapsulates the construction logic, allowing us to create different representations of the same complex object. It promotes code reusability, scalability, and flexibility in object construction, especially when dealing with complex objects that require step-by-step construction or different variations.
