The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, structures, or subsystems. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a unified interface for the client to interact with.

## Components
The Facade pattern consists of the following components:

## Facade: 
Represents the facade that simplifies the interface of the subsystems. It knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request and delegates the client's request to the appropriate objects within the subsystem.

## Subsystem: 
Represents a complex subsystem with multiple components. It encapsulates the functionality and provides specific operations to the facade.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Facade pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the SubsystemA and SubsystemB structs, which represent the subsystems with complex functionality. Each subsystem provides specific operations.
2. We define the Facade struct, which represents the facade. It has references to the subsystems (SubsystemA and SubsystemB).
3. We create a new instance of the facade (NewFacade) that initializes the subsystems.
4. The facade provides a simplified interface (Operation) that wraps the complex operations of the subsystems. It internally calls the specific operations of the subsystems and returns a unified result.
5. In the main function, we create an instance of the facade.
6. We call the simplified operation on the facade, which internally calls the specific operations of the subsystems.
7. We print the result, which demonstrates that the client interacts with the facade to perform complex operations without being aware of the subsystems and their complexities.

By using the Facade pattern, we can provide a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier for clients to use. It encapsulates the complexity of the subsystems and decouples the client from the detailed implementation. The Facade pattern is useful in scenarios where we have a complex system with multiple components and we want to provide a unified interface for client interaction.
