The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending the functionality of objects.

## Components
The Decorator pattern consists of the following components:

## Component: 
Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically. It declares the methods that should be implemented by the concrete components.

## Concrete 
Component: Represents the concrete object that receives additional responsibilities. It implements the methods defined in the Component interface.

## Decorator: 
Serves as the base decorator class that implements the Component interface. It has a reference to a Component object and delegates calls to the underlying component. It can also provide additional behavior before or after delegating the calls.

## Concrete Decorators: 
Represent the concrete decorators that add additional responsibilities to the component. They extend the Decorator class and override its methods to add the desired behavior.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Decorator pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Component interface that declares the Operation() method, which represents the operation that will be implemented by the concrete components.
2. We implement the ConcreteComponent struct, which represents the concrete component. It implements the Operation() method specific to the component.
3. We define the Decorator struct, which serves as the base decorator. It has a component field of the Component interface type.
4. We implement the Operation() method in the Decorator struct by delegating the call to the underlying component.
5. We define the ConcreteDecoratorA and ConcreteDecoratorB structs, which represent the concrete decorators. They extend the Decorator struct and override the Operation() method to add additional behavior before or after calling the component's operation.
6. In the main function, we create an instance of the concrete component (ConcreteComponent).
7. We create instances of the concrete decorators (ConcreteDecoratorA and ConcreteDecoratorB) and wrap the component with the decorator chain.
8. We call the Operation() method on the last decorator in the chain, which internally calls the Operation() methods of all the decorators and the component.
9. We print the result, which demonstrates that the operations are performed in the desired order, with the decorators adding their additional behavior.

By using the Decorator pattern, we can dynamically add responsibilities to objects without modifying their code. It allows us to achieve flexible behavior composition and avoid the proliferation of subclasses. The Decorator pattern is useful in scenarios where we want to add behavior to objects at runtime or when we need to add behavior to multiple objects independently.
