The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures and treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. It lets clients treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly by providing a common interface.

## Components
The Composite pattern consists of the following components:

## Component: 
Defines the common interface for both leaf and composite components. It declares the methods that should be implemented by both types of components.

## Leaf: 
Represents the leaf component that doesn't have any children. It implements the methods defined in the Component interface specific to the leaf.

## Composite: 
Represents the composite component that can have child components. It implements the methods defined in the Component interface specific to the composite. It also maintains a collection of child components.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Composite pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Component interface that declares the Operation() method, which represents the operation that will be implemented by both leaf and composite components.
2. We implement the Leaf struct, which represents the leaf component. It has a Name field and implements the Operation() method specific to the leaf.
3. We implement the Composite struct, which represents the composite component. It has a Name field and a Components field to store child components. It implements the Operation() method by iterating over the child components and calling their Operation() methods.
4. We provide methods AddComponent() and RemoveComponent() in the Composite struct to add and remove child components from the composite.
5. In the main function, we create instances of the leaf components (Leaf) and composite components (Composite).
6. We add leaf components to the composite components using the AddComponent() method.
7. We add the composite component to another composite component using the AddComponent() method.
8. We call the Operation() method on the composite component, which internally calls the Operation() methods of all its child components.
9. We print the result, which demonstrates that the operations are performed on both the leaf and composite components in a uniform manner.

By using the Composite pattern, we can create hierarchical structures of objects where both individual objects and groups of objects can be treated uniformly. This allows us to build complex structures while keeping the code simple and consistent. The Composite pattern is useful in scenarios where we have a recursive structure of objects or when we want to treat a group of objects as a single object.
