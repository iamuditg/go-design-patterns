The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. It helps to separate the abstraction and its implementation into two separate class hierarchies, which can be developed and modified independently.

## Components
The Bridge pattern consists of the following components:

## Implementor: 
Defines the interface for the implementors. It declares the methods that will be implemented by the concrete implementor classes.

## Concrete Implementors: 
Represent the concrete implementations of the implementor interface. They provide the actual implementation of the methods defined in the implementor interface.

## Abstraction: 
Defines the interface for the abstraction. It can provide higher-level operations that are composed of the methods defined in the implementor interface.

## Refined Abstraction: 
Represents the refined abstraction that extends the abstraction. It can add additional methods or functionality to the abstraction.

## Example
In our example, we have implemented the Bridge pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Implementor interface that declares the OperationImpl() method, which represents the operation that will be implemented by the concrete implementor classes.
2. We implement the ConcreteImplementorA and ConcreteImplementorB structs, which represent the concrete implementations of the Implementor interface. They implement the OperationImpl() method with their specific operations.
3. We define the Abstraction interface that declares the Operation() method, which represents the operation that will be performed by the refined abstractions.
4. We implement the RefinedAbstraction struct, which represents the refined abstraction that extends the Abstraction. It implements the Operation() method by delegating the operation to the implementor.
5. In the main function, we create instances of the concrete implementors (ConcreteImplementorA and ConcreteImplementorB).
6. We create instances of the refined abstractions (RefinedAbstraction), each associated with a different implementor.
7. We call the Operation() method on each refined abstraction, which internally delegates the operation to the respective implementor.
8. We print the results, which demonstrate that the operations are performed by the appropriate implementors.

By using the Bridge pattern, we can separate the abstraction and its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This provides flexibility in extending and modifying the system. The Bridge pattern is useful when we have a need to decouple the abstraction and its implementation, especially in scenarios where there are multiple implementations of an abstraction or when there is a need to switch implementations dynamically at runtime.
